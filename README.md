# Futuristic 2D Platformer

A neon-soaked, cyberpunk-inspired 2D platformer built in Unity. Guide your character through multiple levels of rooftop arenas and undercity corridors, blasting patrolling drones and outrunning malfunctioning security bots. Fight with precision-aimed projectiles, manage health and time, and compete for the highest score ever recorded.

## Key Features

* **Dynamic Player Controller**
  Smooth left/right movement, variable jump height, and responsive air control.

* **Enemy AI & Line-of-Sight**
  Patrolling enemies flip to face the player, detect intruders with raycasted vision, and fire accurately only when unblocked by platforms.

* **Precision Shooting**
  Bullets are instantiated toward the player’s position (or in the player’s facing direction) and rotate to match their trajectory.

* **Multi-Level Progression**
  Levels load additively on top of a persistent UI scene. Level Two unlocks automatically when all enemies in Level One are defeated.

* **Persistent UI & Score System**
  A `ScoreManager` singleton tracks score (100 × remaining seconds per kill), timer (30 sec countdown), and health—surviving scene loads until player death.

* **Main Menu & High Score**
  Start, Options, and Quit buttons with pixel-art styling. The main menu displays the all-time high score saved via `PlayerPrefs`.

* **Audio & Visual Polish**
  Looping background music, on-demand gunfire SFX, 9-slice pixel UI, hover/click button animations, and a widescreen 16:9 pixel-art city-night skyline backdrop.
